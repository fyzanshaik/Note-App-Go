Things are tough and I miss her a lot. I wish we would talk listening to sad songs is how I cope at this point. I wish we were together I wish we could talk it out. I know that she has someone else now someone new that she can trust and love or she seeks attention I wish she chose me , chose me over everyone. I don't know whether to be happy or sad because its weird I love this person I am not desperate maybe a little But I wish we worked things out for us. I know I am not good enough for her now or maybe I am I know i have tons of issues , I just wish we would i wish I maybe better. 
I DONT KNOW how to proceed now like what do I do now just ignore and not let things affect me I just wanted to be yours Mahin that's all I ever wanted
