[build]
bin = "./bin/main"  # Path to your build output binary
cmd = "go build -o ${build.bin} ."  # Command to build your application
include = ["*.go", "templates/**/*.html"]  # Files to watch for changes
exclude = ["static"]  # Files to exclude from watching

[logger]
time = true  # Enable logging with timestamps
```

### 5. Run the Application in Development Mode

Use Air to start the application with live-reloading:

```bash
air
```

This will start the application and automatically restart the server when changes are detected.
